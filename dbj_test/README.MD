> Visual Studio 2019 solution.


This does not mean we are abandoning Linux and Mac OS users. But. Our primary platform is WIN SVR. 

If you can use VS 2019, please make sure you build with and without ["/kernel"](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/
kernel-create-kernel-mode-binary?view=vs-2019) switch.

If you are not Windows an developer please do let us know of problems you have faced.

Yes, yes ... CIRCLE CI is in the making. Stay tuned :wink:
